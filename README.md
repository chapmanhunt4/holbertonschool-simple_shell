# Holberton Simple Shell Recreation

The Following is a recreation of Shell. It is not as functional as your typical terminal, but can do the job in a pinch. 




## Introduction

The following Shell is designed to be used both as an interactive program and a non interactive program. You can launch and use the shell, or pass parameters to the shell which will launch, execute the command and exit. 


## Installation

You can install this shell by forking the following github repository

https://github.com/chapmanhunt4/holbertonschool-simple_shell


## Compilation

This shell program was written with Betty Documentation style in mind, based on the C89 standard of C. You should use the following code to compile your program

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```


## File List

##### header.h - The header file for Shell. This includes all the system header files and function lists.
____
##### main.c - The heart of the shell. This is what starts the loop (if ran as a terminal), gets the arguments and processes the command.
____
##### executeCommand.c - Takes the arguments passed and executes the proper command.
____
##### copyFile.c - Simple function that takes a file and copies it.
## Flowchart

I had a flowchart that I was updating throughout the project, but for the life of me can't remember the website I used and can't find it...
